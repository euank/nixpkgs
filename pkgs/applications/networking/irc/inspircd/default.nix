  # So, this package is still not ready for prime-time. Why not?
  # Well, two reasons:
  # 1. the postInstallPhase include stuff below doesn't actually work. No clue
  # why.
  # 2. include probably is being handled wrong, as are modules
  # So for 2, what do I mean? Ideally we want the longer-term thing to be that
  # the inspircd bin is one output (what you run), the modules are another
  # (which the bin loads dynamically), and the include is a third (which is
  # used for compiling out-of-tree modules).
  # Using multiple outputs is something I'm not super familiar with, so I
  # didn't get it working to my satisfaction.
  # I'm going to just leave this bad derivation off in my tree and use it for
  # now, but I'll go back and ask for help on #nixos or on a PR in the future
  # and get this merged.
